# Security Update Documentation - InterviewBot Backend

## Overview

This security update modernizes the InterviewBot backend authentication system with industry best practices. The previous implementation had several security vulnerabilities that have been addressed.

## Security Improvements

### 1. JWT Token Management

**Before:**
- Used deprecated `python-jose` library
- Single long-lived access tokens (1 hour)
- Hardcoded JWT secret
- No token revocation mechanism

**After:**
- Modern `PyJWT` library with enhanced security
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- Environment-based JWT secrets with proper validation
- Token blacklisting and revocation system
- Enhanced JWT claims (issuer, audience, unique token ID)

### 2. Password Security

**Before:**
- Basic password validation (min 6 chars, 1 letter, 1 number)
- Standard bcrypt rounds
- No password strength analysis

**After:**
- Comprehensive password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
- Higher bcrypt rounds (12) for better security
- Password strength analysis using `zxcvbn`
- Protection against common password patterns
- Password history tracking (prevents reuse)

### 3. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection

**Before:**
- No rate limiting
- No account lockout protection

**After:**
- Rate limiting on all authentication endpoints
- Account lockout after failed login attempts (5 attempts â†’ 15-minute lockout)
- IP-based and email-based tracking
- Configurable rate limits per endpoint type

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Before:**
- Basic email format validation
- Minimal input sanitization

**After:**
- Enhanced email validation with typo detection
- Comprehensive input sanitization for all user data
- Protection against injection attacks
- Length limits and character filtering

### 5. Security Headers & Middleware

**Before:**
- Basic CORS configuration
- No security headers

**After:**
- Security headers middleware (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Enhanced CORS configuration with specific methods and headers
- Rate limiting middleware with customizable limits
- Request logging for security monitoring

### 6. Error Handling & Information Disclosure

**Before:**
- Detailed error messages that could leak information
- Stack traces in production

**After:**
- Generic error messages in production
- Detailed logging for debugging without exposing sensitive info
- No stack traces or internal details exposed to clients

## New Security Features

### Refresh Token System

- Access tokens expire quickly (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens allow seamless token renewal
- Refresh tokens can be revoked individually or in bulk
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

### Account Security

- Failed login attempt tracking
- Automatic account lockout with configurable duration
- Security information endpoint for users
- Admin-only user management endpoints

### Enhanced Monitoring

- Comprehensive security logging
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Background cleanup tasks for expired data
- Health checks with security considerations

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Critical Security Settings
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-32-chars-minimum
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

# Password Security
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN=5/minute
RATE_LIMIT_SIGNUP=3/minute
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5
LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES=15
```

### Frontend Integration Changes

The frontend needs to be updated to handle the new authentication flow:

1. **Login Response Changes:**
```typescript
// New response includes refresh token
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "user": { ... }
}
```

2. **Token Refresh Endpoint:**
```typescript
POST /auth/refresh
Headers: X-Refresh-Token: <refresh_token>
```

3. **Enhanced Logout:**
```typescript
POST /auth/logout
Headers: 
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  X-Refresh-Token: <refresh_token>
```

## API Changes

### New Endpoints

- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /auth/revoke-all-tokens` - Revoke all user tokens
- `GET /auth/security-info` - Get user security information
- `POST /auth/change-password` - Change user password (to be implemented)

### Modified Endpoints

- `POST /auth/signup` - Enhanced validation and response format
- `POST /auth/login` - Enhanced security and response format
- `POST /auth/logout` - Enhanced token revocation
- `GET /auth/profile` - Additional security information

### Rate Limiting

All authentication endpoints now have rate limiting:
- Login: 5 attempts per minute
- Signup: 3 attempts per minute
- General API: 100 requests per minute

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

1. **Update Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Update Environment Configuration:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update all security-related environment variables
   - Generate a strong JWT secret key

3. **Update Frontend Code:**
   - Modify authentication service to handle refresh tokens
   - Update token storage and renewal logic
   - Handle new error response formats

### Database Migration

The new system adds fields to user documents:
- `password_history`: Array of previous password hashes
- `active_refresh_tokens`: Array of active refresh token JTIs
- `security_settings`: Object with security-related fields
- `email_verified`: Boolean for email verification status

Existing users will have these fields added automatically.

## Production Deployment

### Critical Security Checklist

- [ ] Set `DEBUG=false` in production
- [ ] Use a strong, unique `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (32+ characters)
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Use MongoDB Atlas or secured MongoDB instance
- [ ] Configure proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up Redis for production rate limiting (optional)
- [ ] Review and configure all rate limits appropriately
- [ ] Set up proper backup and recovery procedures

### Recommended Additional Security Measures

1. **Use Redis for Rate Limiting:**
   - In-memory rate limiting is suitable for single-instance deployments
   - Use Redis for multi-instance or high-scale deployments

2. **Implement Email Verification:**
   - Add email verification workflow
   - Prevent unverified accounts from accessing sensitive features

3. **Add Two-Factor Authentication:**
   - Implement TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced security
   - Consider SMS or email-based backup codes

4. **Security Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity
   - Monitor failed login attempts and rate limit violations
   - Log security events to external monitoring systems

## Testing

### Security Testing

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Test signup with various password strengths
   - Verify rate limiting on auth endpoints
   - Test account lockout mechanism
   - Verify token refresh workflow

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Test with malicious input payloads
   - Verify email validation and sanitization
   - Test file upload security (if applicable)

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Test rate limit enforcement
   - Verify rate limit headers
   - Test rate limit bypass attempts

### Load Testing

- Test performance impact of enhanced security measures
- Verify rate limiting doesn't affect legitimate users
- Test token refresh performance under load

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **JWT Secret Not Set:**
   - Error: "Token verification failed"
   - Solution: Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in .env file

2. **Rate Limiting Too Restrictive:**
   - Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
   - Solution: Adjust rate limits in configuration

3. **Account Locked:**
   - Error: "Account temporarily locked"
   - Solution: Wait for lockout duration or reset manually

4. **Frontend Token Issues:**
   - Error: "Invalid refresh token"
   - Solution: Update frontend to handle new token format

### Monitoring and Logging

Check logs for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
